                Urbanization is a crucial dynamic for food supply. The urban poor, approximately 1.2 billion people, are highly vulnerable to rising food and energy prices. </p>

              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Food scarcity</strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">By June 2022 the number of acute food insecure people – whose access to food in the short term has been restricted to the point that their lives and livelihoods are at risk – increased to 345 million in 82 countries according to WFP.</p>
              
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Food wastage</strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">As much as 50 kilogram of food is wasted by each person every year in India, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution, told the Lok Sabha March 30, 2022.</p>

              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Food scarcity</strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">In this report, distinguished researchers, policymakers, and practitioners review what happened in food policy in 2014 at the global, regional, and national levels, and—supported by the latest knowledge and research—explain why. This year’s report is the first to also look forward a year, offering analysis of the potential opportunities and challenges that we will face in achieving food and nutrition security in 2015.</p>
              
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Food wastage</strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">The estimated economic value of post-harvest losses in India was INR 926.51 billion (USD 15.19 billion) in 2014. While this is an underestimation of overall food loss and waste in India, India ranks only 94th out of 107 countries on the 2020 Global Hunger Index. Any amount of food loss and waste is a wasted opportunity to increase food availability, improve income, easing pressure on land and water resources, and reducing GHGs.</p>
